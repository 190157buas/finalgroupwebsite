		<p class="p">For our website, we wanted to create a calm looking. The color yellow stands for optimism, energy and loyalty. This is also what we want to communicate to our customers. By choosing a lighter yellow color, it creates the calm looking. Our codes we have used are:</p>
		
	  <h1 class="h5">Fonts</h1>
		<p class="p">For the font, we have used two different google fonts. For the titles, we have used a bolder font, because this communicates power. Power fits good to our brand because people should get power from our brand after they have made use of our services. The font for the paragraphs, we want to keep calm, because that makes it readable easily. The google fonts we have used are: </p>
		
	  <h1 class="h5">Flow Chart</h1>
		<p class="p">In the flow chart below, you can see the structure we have followed. Our team have chosen for a clear navigation bar because that keeps the calmness for our website. Also, you see that at the home page, you could immediately go to the services we offer. Our team finds this important, because our services is what we most care for. You also have a “booking-option” on the service tab, because we want to encourage our customers to book with our company. </p>

		<h1 class="h5">Testing Phase</h1>
		<p class="p">For our paper wireframe, we have used Canva to create an easy, but understandable prototype. We have interviewed 5 people for our wireframe in order to make sure that our website would flow well before we would make the real website. During the testing phase, we discovered that putting the profile on the first page wasn't the best to do. Also, we had to add a login page, because we forgot to put that in at first. Moreover, we first had 'contact us' as a seperated page, however, we discovered that this was not needed. Therefore, we put it under about us, so our users also don't have to click to much. We repeat our services on purpose, because we believe that it makes our customers aware of what we offer. During the testing phase, we could confirm that it worked, because from all the five users, we got that as feedback. All in all, the testing phase helped us creating the real website and we are more than excited to start off with the real work.</p>

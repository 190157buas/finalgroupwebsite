	  <h1 class="h5">Colors</h1>
		<p class="p">For our website, we wanted to create a calm looking. The color yellow stands for optimism, energy and loyalty. This is also what we want to communicate to our customers. By choosing a lighter yellow color, it creates the calm looking. We also have used the color black, because it makes it easy readable, it fits to our logo and it communicates 'bold' as well. Namely, our brand sees bold as being strong which fits well to the brand values.  Our codes we have used are:
			<br><br><b>#FFCF6F</b> for the navigation bar.  
			<br><b>#000000</b> for the normal text.
			<br><b>#FFB115</b> for the buttons, headers, and important text we wanted to highlight.
			</p>
		
	  <h1 class="h5">Fonts</h1>
		<p class="p">For the font, we have used three different google fonts. For the titles, we have used a bolder font, because this communicates power. Power fits good to our brand message because people should get power from our brand after they have made use of our services. The font for the paragraphs, we wanted to keep it calm, because that makes it readable easily. The google fonts we have used are: <br><br><b>Secular One</b> for the headings. All letters, which have used the Secure One font, are written in capital letters. <br><b>Roboto</b> for the other text. We have used different font sizes throughout the document. <br><b>Faustina</b> for the vision and mission. </p>
		
	  <h1 class="h5">Flow Chart</h1>
		<p class="p">In the flow chart below, you can see the structure we have followed. Our team have chosen for a clear navigation bar because that keeps the calmness for our website. Also, you see that at the home page, you could immediately go to the services we offer. Our team finds this important, because our services is what we most care for. You also have a “booking-option” on the service tab, because we want to encourage our customers to book with our company. </p>

		<h1 class="h5">Testing Phase</h1>
		<p class="p">For our paper wireframe, we have used Canva to create an easy, but understandable prototype. We have interviewed 5 people for every phase (in total 10) in order to make sure that our website would flow well before we would make the real website. We have done the testing in two phases. In the first phase, we asked if the participant knew what the brand was about. In the second phase, we asked the participants if they could book a meditating appointment for 4 persons on May 3rd at 13.00h via the service page. <br><br>During the testing phase, we discovered that putting the profile on the first page wasn't the best to do. Also, we had to add a login page, because we forgot to put that in at first. Moreover, we first had 'contact us' as a seperated page, however, we discovered that this was not needed. Therefore, we put it under about us, so our users also don't have to click too many times. We repeat our services on purpose, because we believe that it makes our customers aware of what we offer. During the testing phase, we could confirm that it worked, because from all the five users, we got that as feedback. All in all, the testing phase helped us creating the real website and we are more than excited to start off with the real work.</p>
